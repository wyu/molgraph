# molgraph
MOLGRAPH is an aggregated molecular networks backed by a graph datastore such as Neo4J. The network embodies the beliefs and assertions curated from primary data sources concerning protein-protein interactions, pathways, GWAS catalog, etc. The basic entities of the graph are the genes,

The graph will serve as the basis for the visulization of gene list, as well as the algorithms that operate on the graph. It's intended that the curation will be crowd sourced.
