# molgraph
MOLGRAPH is a contextualized belief network inspired by the Bio4J project. The network embodies the crowd-sourced facts, interactions and assertions curated from primary data sources concerning protein-protein interactions, pathways, GWAS catalog, etc.

The summary level data from data pipelines or databases can be encoded in the network to promote data sharing and reasoning. API or Cypher access will be offered for data scientists. The graph will eventually serve as the basis for the visual exploration for the curious minds.
